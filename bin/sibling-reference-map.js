 *
 * Every `src/` path of THIS repo that a sibling repo names, and who names it.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Moving or renaming a file under src/ is a cross-repo edit
 * whenever another service reaches into this checkout for it, and several do:
 * sibling suites require this repo's modules by relative path, build DDL paths by
 * hand, and quote module paths inside assertions. A grep run by hand finds the
 * requires and misses the string literals, so the restructure needs ONE
 * mechanical sweep whose output can be diffed before and after a move. A path
 * that leaves this map without a matching edit in the referring repo is a
 * broken sibling, and that break surfaces at the referrer's next CI run rather
 * than at the commit that caused it.
 *
 * WHAT COUNTS AS A REFERENCE. Six shapes, reported as each site's `form`,
 * because a rename tool has to find every one of them:
 *
 *   text       any literal run of `xchain-vm/src/<path>` in any text file:
 *              a relative require, a comment, a shell script, a markdown runbook.
 *   join       a path built segment by segment, the shape
 *              path.join(root, 'xchain-vm', 'src', 'foo.js'). When every
 *              segment after `src` is a literal the path is resolved; when one is
 *              a variable the site is reported under `dynamicReferences` instead,
 *              because a rename must be checked there by a human.
 *   root-var   the checkout held in a variable and the file joined onto it:
 *              `const R = path.resolve(__dirname, '../../xchain-vm')` then
 *              path.join(R, 'src', 'foo.js'), path.join(R, 'src/foo.js') or
 *              `${R}/src/foo.js`. The root may equally be
 *              process.env.XCHAIN_VM_PATH, a candidate array filtered to its
 *              first live entry, or a variable that points at `<root>/src`.
 *   helper     a closure that takes a repo-relative path and returns a file in
 *              this checkout, `vmFile('src/rollback.js')`. A call over a
 *              literal array, `vmFile('src/' + twin)`, is emitted once per
 *              element of that array.
 *   shell-var  the same root-in-a-variable idea in bash, `"$VAR/src/foo.js"`.
 *   shell-arg  the repo name passed as its own word with the path beside it,
 *              `copy_twin xchain-vm "src/$f"`, resolved against the literal
 *              `for f in ...` list above it. The twin-copier script in the
 *              platform's tooling directories, reconcile-twins.sh, is built
 *              entirely out of this one and is wired into no CI.
 *
 * AND ONE THAT IS NEVER A PATH. A module loaded with `require('./' + mod)` over
 * a literal list is named by no string at all, so a missed move can report a
 * gate ABSENT rather than throwing. This repo builds no such require today, but
 * the form is still detected, because the first one to land would otherwise be
 * invisible: those sites are listed under `dynamicReferences` with the file list
 * they resolve to, form `computed-require`.
 *
 * SCOPE. Sibling repos are the `xchain-*` directories beside this checkout
 * (`--siblings <dir>` overrides the search root), listed in `siblingRepos`. That
 * default scope is everything this repo publishes and everything a pin carries.
 *
 * The surrounding tree may also hold platform tooling that is not a shipped
 * service and still reaches in just as hard: the twin-copier script
 * reconcile-twins.sh alone byte-copies about thirty of this repo's src/ files
 * outward and no CI job runs it, so a sweep that ignores those directories reads
 * safer than the tree is. Sweeping them is OPT-IN, because their paths belong to
 * the tree around this checkout rather than to this repo: pass
 * --include-platform-tooling and name the directories, relative to the siblings
 * root and comma-separated, in SIBLING_MAP_EXTRA_DIRS. Their hits land under the
 * referrer label `platform-tooling` and the directories swept are echoed in
 * `platformToolingSwept`, so a map that used them says so. With the flag off,
 * `platformToolingSwept` is empty and only the `xchain-*` siblings are swept.
