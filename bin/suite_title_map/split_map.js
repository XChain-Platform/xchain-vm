 *
 * One pinned test file declared as several, for bin/suite-title-map.js.
 *
 * WHY A SEPARATE RECORD. The rename map is one-to-one on purpose: a pure move
 * keeps a file's whole title set under one new key, so the ordinary per-file
 * compare still proves nothing entered or left it. A file split into several
 * cannot be written as renames, and comparing each new file on its own reports
 * the old file dropped and every part added, a wall of differences a reviewer
 * ends up waving through by eye. That is exactly the failure the pin exists to
 * stop, so a split is declared, and graded as one unit.
 *
 * WHAT HOLDS. For every script that pinned the old file, the titles the named
 * parts collect, taken together, equal the old file's titles exactly, counted
 * as a multiset: no title lost, none added, none carried by two parts (a title
 * mocha reported twice in the old file must appear twice in total). A title
 * that left the old file for a file the record does not name is reported as
 * moved, with where it went, rather than as a bare drop, so the record has to
 * account for every title's destination.
 *
 * A part that a script does not collect is not itself a finding: under a
 * --grep script a part can hold no matching title at all. Only the union is
 * graded, and a title the old file never had shows up as added either way.
 *
 * RENAMES APPLY FIRST. The split map is keyed by the path the compare sees
 * once the rename map has been applied to the pin, which is the path the file
 * has in the tree just before it is split. A structured rename map's `titles`
 * under that path are applied first too, so a split can land beside a declared
 * title rename and the union is graded against the titles as renamed.
 *
 * THE RECORD. Either a house record whose `splits` key holds the map
 * (bin/pins/suite-title-splits.json) or a flat object of the same shape:
 *   { "test/unit/a.test.js": ["test/unit/a_reads.test.js", "test/unit/a_writes.test.js"] }
 * A part may keep the old path. Every part list names at least two files; a
 * single destination is a rename and belongs in --rename-map.
