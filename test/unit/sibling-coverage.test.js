// What this suite exists to stop: a GREEN run that verified less than it looks
// like it did.
//
// Four guards across test/unit and test/determinism are byte-identity or
// value-parity checks against a SIBLING checkout (the XCALL constants against
// xchain-indexer, xchain-sdk and xchain-documentation, lint parity against the
// shipped contract templates). Every one of them resolves its sibling with
// existsSync and calls this.skip() when it is absent. That is the right
// behaviour for a single-repo checkout, and it is invisible: mocha reports a
// skipped test as `pending`, the suite still exits 0, and the push gate prints
// PASS. A sibling the CI venue was never told to ship (.ci-siblings) is
// therefore indistinguishable, in the output, from one whose guards all ran
// and passed.
//
// Measured 2026-08-12 against a full local checkout, a venue carrying only
// this repo's then-declared siblings ran 901 passing / 19 pending where a full
// checkout runs 920 / 13, and the two undeclared siblings were xchain-sdk and
// xchain-contracts, which carry lint-core and contract-template parity. The
// count comes from Linux: isolated-vm does not load on macOS, so it cannot be
// taken there.
//
// This file does not intercept those skips (that would mean rewriting every
// guard, which is the sort of churn that breaks what it means to protect). It
// answers the question their silence leaves open: WHICH siblings were
// resolvable for this run, and therefore which guard families could not have
// run. The summary prints on every run, pass or fail.
//
// XCHAIN_REQUIRE_SIBLINGS=1 turns absence into a FAILURE, matching the switch
// the individual guards already honour, so a venue that is supposed to carry
// the full checkout proves it rather than asserting it. Default (unset) stays
// permissive so a single-repo clone is green.
//
