## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- XChainVM class with `execute()`, `validateSyntax()`, `checkFloatWarnings()`, `beginBlock()`/`endBlock()` API
- Sandboxed V8 isolate execution via isolated-vm with all non-deterministic APIs stripped
- AST-based gas metering via acorn/acorn-walk/astring — injects `__gas()` calls at control flow points
- Gateway object (`xchain.*`) with state CRUD, balance/token queries, oracle/cross-chain stubs, emit API, deterministic math, revert/require, logging
- 16 emittable action types: SEND, DESTROY, ISSUE, MINT, ORDER, DISPENSER, DIVIDEND, AIRDROP, CALLBACK, FILE, LIST, COINPAY, SWEEP, LINK, BROADCAST, MESSAGE
- Deterministic math (`xchain.math.*`) wrapping mathjs bignumber with string I/O
- StateManager with dirty tracking, key count limits, value size limits, delete-then-set cycle support
- EmissionCollector with configurable emission cap and log collection (100 entries, 1KB each)
- ActionValidator for pre-validation of emitted actions
- Deploy-time syntax validation (V8 + acorn), reserved identifier detection (`__gas`), float usage warnings
- Per-block compilation cache using V8 `createCachedData()`/`cachedData` for hot contracts
- ContractRevertError and GasExhaustedError error classification
- 81 unit tests covering metering, gas, math, state, collector, compilation, sandbox, gateway, limits, determinism, syntax
- 13 fixture contracts: simple_send, state_counter, amm_swap, vesting, multi_method, infinite_loop, memory_bomb, sandbox_escape, emit_flood, state_flood, bad_math, compile_bomb, oracle_read
